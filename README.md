hapi-couch-user
===============

A hapi.js plugin for user authentication.

Modelled after [express-couchUser](https://github.com/twilson63/express-couchUser) and [lockit](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit).

This is an experiment, I'm not even sure I will be able to 'finish' it by myself.

Todo's

* Define the API
* Write the tests
* Implement the shit
* Create an example
* Live the dream
